# Windows 98 Calculator

This is a basic calculator app built to emulate the classic Windows 98 (ugly but nostalgic) UI.
I built this as a fun little project to solidify essential React concepts. Currently all keys work 
except the memory functions.

## Built With

- React.js
- [98.css](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/)

## License

MIT. Do whatever you want with it :).
